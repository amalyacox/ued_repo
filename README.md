Functions for analyzing diffraction images from MeV UED experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. 
Experimental data consists of time dependent diffraction images of MoS2/WS2 and MoSe2/WSe2 van der Waals Heterostructures. 


RMS atomic displacement data obtained using standard Debye-Waller Theory on Bragg peak intensity change vs. Q.
